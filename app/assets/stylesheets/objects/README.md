## Style Guide Layouts

**Layout Naming Conventions**

1. Layout combination classes use the **l** prefix for 'layout'. Layout variations are declared by appending **-** and a character **or** numeric identifier to **l** depending on what you need. For example **.l-sg** represents a simple layout block for the main style guide content.
